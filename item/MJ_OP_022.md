## Reported verbatim in the *Woman’s Journal* March 11, 1911, page 2.
 
At the suffrage dinner recently given in Baltimore, Miss Mary Johnston said:

#### **All United**

It is so comfortable to know that we are all of one mind! No opponents, no antagonists!—just us. It is lovely to be addressing a co-operative conclusion—our conclusion. Wherever look, I see my own opinion in a certain great matter. I uphold that opinion; I believe it to be a right opinion, an adequate idea, and I am glad and glad again to meet it here in such strength tonight.
